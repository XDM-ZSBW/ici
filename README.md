## Mission & Vision

**Purpose**: ICI is an open-source AI memory companion designed with and for individuals with cognitive disabilities, providing ethical, privacy-respecting memory support.

**Mission**: To enhance independence and well-being through AI-powered, personalized memory assistance that empowers rather than replaces human agency.

**Vision**: A world where cognitive support technology is accessible, dignified, and designed by the communities it serves.

## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Memory Support**: Intelligent reminders, prompts, and memory organization tailored to individual needs and preferences.
- **Collaborative Memory Sharing**: Three memory scopes with user control:
  - **Private Memory**: Personal, secure storage for individual use
  - **IP Shared Memory**: Shared with trusted devices on the same network
  - **Shared Memory**: Community memory for broader collaboration
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: ~~Instant updates across devices using WebSockets for seamless memory access.~~
- **QR Code Authentication**: Simple, accessible authentication system for easy device linking.
- **Adaptive Interface**: UI that learns and adapts to user preferences and accessibility needs.
- **Privacy-First Design**: User-controlled data sharing with transparent privacy policies.
- **Progressive Confirmation System**: "Unapologetically naggy" confirmation methodology that ensures user understanding and safety through multiple explanation methods and accessible confirmations.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase supporting ongoing development and customization.

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Confirmation & Accessibility
ICI implements an intentionally thorough confirmation system that prioritizes user safety and understanding over convenience. This "unapologetically naggy" approach includes:

- **Multi-Modal Explanations**: Actions are explained through various methods (visual, textual, interactive) to accommodate different learning styles and accessibility needs
- **Progressive Detail**: Information is presented with increasing detail and context to ensure comprehensive understanding
- **Graceful Repetition**: The system will ask for confirmation multiple times in different ways, particularly for significant actions
- **Accessibility-First Design**: All confirmations work seamlessly with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies
- **User Agency**: Maintains user control and informed consent throughout all interactions

This methodology ensures that individuals with cognitive disabilities maintain full autonomy while receiving appropriate support and protection.

## üöÄ Running the Application

**Use `app.py` as the ONLY entry point for all environments (local & Cloud Run):**

```sh
python app.py
```

- For local development, HTTPS is auto-configured if certs are present.
- For Cloud Run, simply deploy with `app.py` as the entrypoint (Cloud Run handles SSL termination).

## Auth & QR Code

- When a user scans a QR code on the chat page, the QR disappears and the UI updates to show client details (from client.html). The user's wallet address is now used as the unique identifier for all memory and chat operations, instead of the previous guest env-id. Memory continuity is preserved.

## QR Code Authentication Flow

When a user scans the QR code on the chat page:
- The QR code UI disappears.
- The client details UI (from client.html) is shown in its place.
- All chat and memory operations now use the wallet address as the unique identifier (user_id), instead of the previous guest env-id.
- Memory continuity is preserved: the user's previous chat history and facts remain accessible, now associated with their wallet address.
