## Mission & Vision

**Purpose**: ICI is an open-source AI memory companion designed with and for individuals with cognitive disabilities, providing ethical, privacy-respecting memory support.

**Mission**: To enhance independence and well-being through AI-powered, personalized memory assistance that empowers rather than replaces human agency.

**Vision**: A world where cognitive support technology is accessible, dignified, and designed by the communities it serves.

## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Memory Support**: Intelligent reminders, prompts, and memory organization tailored to individual needs and preferences.
- **Collaborative Memory Sharing**: Three memory scopes with user control:
  - **Private Memory**: Personal, secure storage for individual use
  - **IP Shared Memory**: Shared with trusted devices on the same network
  - **Shared Memory**: Community memory for broader collaboration
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: ~~Instant updates across devices using WebSockets for seamless memory access.~~
- **QR Code Authentication**: Simple, accessible authentication system for easy device linking.
- **Adaptive Interface**: UI that learns and adapts to user preferences and accessibility needs.
- **Privacy-First Design**: User-controlled data sharing with transparent privacy policies.
- **Progressive Confirmation System**: "Unapologetically naggy" confirmation methodology that ensures user understanding and safety through multiple explanation methods and accessible confirmations.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable codebase supporting ongoing development and customization.

## Design Philosophy

### Progressive Confirmation & Accessibility
ICI implements an intentionally thorough confirmation system that prioritizes user safety and understanding over convenience. This "unapologetically naggy" approach includes:

- **Multi-Modal Explanations**: Actions are explained through various methods (visual, textual, interactive) to accommodate different learning styles and accessibility needs
- **Progressive Detail**: Information is presented with increasing detail and context to ensure comprehensive understanding
- **Graceful Repetition**: The system will ask for confirmation multiple times in different ways, particularly for significant actions
- **Accessibility-First Design**: All confirmations work seamlessly with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies
- **User Agency**: Maintains user control and informed consent throughout all interactions

This methodology ensures that individuals with cognitive disabilities maintain full autonomy while receiving appropriate support and protection.

## Architecture

   - Visit: https://localhost:8080

## Google Cloud Run Deployment
- Use the provided `Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Cloud Run provides HTTPS by default‚Äîno extra SSL config needed.
- For persistent memory, use Google Cloud Storage or Firestore.
- Ensure all environment variables and secrets are set in Cloud Run.

## Lessons Learned / Nuggets

### SSL & HTTPS for Local Dev
- Many browser APIs (like screenshot capture) require HTTPS, even for localhost.
- Use Flask's SSL support with self-signed certs for local testing.
- Automate cert generation with OpenSSL in your launcher script.
- If OpenSSL is missing, fail fast and print a clear error.

### OpenSSL on Windows
- Download from [slproweb.com](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
- Add the `bin` directory to your PATH so Python can find `openssl.exe`.

### Cloud Run Deployment
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Optimized for Google Cloud Run with 1 CPU and 512MB RAM
- Use a `Dockerfile` based on `python:3.9-slim` for minimal footprint
- Expose port 8080 and use HTTPS (Cloud Run handles certs)
- **No Heavy Dependencies**: Removed transformers, torch, and vector databases for faster builds
- **Fast Cold Starts**: Lightweight implementation eliminates model loading delays

### AI Chat & Memory
- **Text-Based Search**: Uses efficient string matching instead of vector embeddings
- **Memory System**: Lightweight in-memory storage with simple text-based retrieval
- Store user memories and include them in the prompt for context
- For screenshots, use OCR to extract text and store as memory

## API Endpoints

- `/ai-chat` ‚Äî POST: Chat as guest (uses env-id for memory)
- `/ai-chat-enhanced` ‚Äî POST: Chat with file/screenshot support
- `/client-register` ‚Äî POST: Register a client (returns wallet address)
- `/client-heartbeat` ‚Äî POST: Client keepalive

## Auth & QR Code

- When a user scans a QR code on the chat page, the QR disappears and the UI updates to show client details (from client.html). The user's wallet address is now used as the unique identifier for all memory and chat operations, instead of the previous guest env-id. Memory continuity is preserved.

## Enhanced Authentication & Security Features

### Secure Client ID System
- **256-bit Hex Client IDs**: Cryptographically secure client identification
- **Legacy ID Detection**: Automatic detection and cleanup of old wallet-style IDs (0x... pattern)
- **Secure Generation**: Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for entropy
- **MFA Integration**: Resolves authentication errors and log spam

### QR Code Authentication (Updated May 27, 2025)
- **Dynamic QR Display**: QR code appears above the "Ask AI" textarea on the chat page
- **Real-time Synchronization**: QR code disappears across all tabs/devices once authenticated
- **Session Management**: Live client session table with real-time updates
- **Device Linking**: Seamless device authentication and memory continuity
- **No Duplicate QR Codes**: Eliminated legacy QR code logic for clean user experience

### Progressive Confirmation System
The "unapologetically naggy" confirmation methodology ensures user safety:
- **Multi-Modal Explanations**: Visual, textual, and interactive confirmations
- **Accessibility Integration**: Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation
- **Graceful Repetition**: Multiple confirmation methods for important actions
- **User Agency**: Maintains informed consent throughout all interactions
