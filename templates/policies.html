    <h1>Policies, Terms, and Governance</h1>
    <p>This page describes the terms, conditions, and governance policies for the ICI Collaborative Memory Web App.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Data Governance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All chat and memory data is stored in-memory and may be lost at any time.</li>
      <li>For production use, persistent storage and additional privacy controls are required.</li>
      <li>Contact the administrator for questions about data handling or privacy.</li>
    </ul>    <h2>Progressive Confirmation and Accessibility Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      ICI implements an "unapologetically naggy" confirmation methodology designed to ensure
      user safety and accessibility across all ability levels. This approach includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Progressive Explanation</strong>: Actions are explained in multiple ways with increasing detail and clarity.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Modal Confirmations</strong>: Confirmations use various methods (visual, textual, interactive) to accommodate different accessibility needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Graceful Repetition</strong>: The system will ask multiple times in different ways to ensure understanding, particularly for destructive or significant actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Contextual Warnings</strong>: Clear, contextual explanations of consequences before actions are taken.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility-First</strong>: All confirmations are designed to work with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This design philosophy prioritizes user agency and informed consent over convenience, ensuring that
      individuals with cognitive disabilities maintain full control and understanding of their interactions
      with the system. The "naggy" approach is intentional and considered a feature, not a bug.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Automated Development Tools and Practices</h2>
    <p>
      This project leverages automated development tools, techniques, patterns, and practices,
      including but not limited to AI-assisted code generation, automated testing, and
      continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) principles where applicable.
      The use of these tools and practices is intended to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance development speed and efficiency.</li>
      <li>Improve code quality and reduce human error.</li>
      <li>Facilitate rapid iteration and deployment of new features.</li>
      <li>Ensure consistent application of coding standards and best practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While these tools significantly aid in the development process, all critical code
      and architectural decisions are reviewed by human developers to ensure alignment
      with project goals, security standards, and maintainability.
